#Installation Instructions

##Prism Launcher (Recommended)

1. Click 'Add Instance'.
2. Under 'Import' paste the URL from the releases section for either Modrinth (.mrpack) or Cursefoge (.zip)

You can do something very similar on Modrinth launcher I believe.

##Make Modpack

With Packwiz:
git clone https://github.com/bloodwolfepc/modpack

'packwiz mr export' for Modrinth
'packwiz cf export' for Curseforge
